# Negotiating Update 25-06
 
Our committee has several noteworthy items to report following this week's bargaining sessions. The published agenda listed "Retirement, Work Rules, and any other issues/sections the parties are prepared to address." In addition to Retirement and Work Rules, Scope and Compensation were advanced. With that in mind, we'll relate each section's associated issues and events.
 
Retirement
 
The Company provided a Retirement proposal, their second pass with our committee on this subject. The Company brought no new or additional money to the table. The difference in this pass was structural. Previously, the Company proposed a similar Retirement structure to TA '23. As a quick reminder, that construct is a choice between the Legacy Defined Benefit Plan with a singular $330K FAE cap (no escalation) and a Market Based Cash Balance Plan funded by 11% Compensation Credits up to IRS Compensation Limit ($350K for 2025), with current book DC (9% capped at the same IRS Compensation Limit). Those who transition would be subject to a $ 290K FAE cap.
 
Additionally, at the core of their proposal is the closure of the Legacy Defined Benefit Plan to new entrants after the Date of Signing (DOS). This week, the Legacy DB Plan component remained unchanged. However, the alternative plan to the Legacy DB Plan was an 18% Defined Contribution Plan with "cash over the cap" (no spill into an MBCBP), with an unfortunate limit of 1,000 times the 15-year Wide Body Captain pay rate. That limit is a non-industry standard. A similar attempt of a limiter by United management found its way into the overwhelmingly rejected "Tumi" TA, which experienced a 94% rejection rate in 2022. Retirement bargaining is complex and contains difficult challenges. None of which is insurmountable.
 
Scope
 
The Company continues to hold our full-language Scope proposal from six weeks ago. Our outside counsel joined us this week to facilitate the Company's eventual response. Although no formal bargaining occurred, a lengthy dialogue ensued between the bargaining principals. The desire was to create understanding and potential mutually acceptable pathways to agreement on multiple issues within Section One. Like Retirement, Scope contains challenging and complex subjects that require hard work.
 
Work Rules
 
Sections 4, 12, and 25 were the subject of two bargaining passes this week, first by the Company and then by us. Our four major issues remain: Reserves, Extensions, Revisions, and 4A2b/c.
 
Presently, the most troubling issue lies with Revisions. Not that the Company has embraced our concepts in the other listed areas, but that Revisions, specifically compensation for them, have achieved zero traction with the Company.
 
For months, the Company refused to acknowledge the Revisions' prevalence and problematic nature. Now, as we continue to advocate on your behalf regarding their disruptive nature and seniority abrogation, we find that "tariffs" and the new nature of air cargo have made them a staple of our working lives and that they are in no way eligible for recompense. We pointed out that these revisions existed well before Inauguration Day. The Company must appropriately address Revisions, as we cannot envision participating in a TA Road Show that contains a glaring hole regarding Revisions. We know that you will not tolerate such an oversight.
 
Compensation
 
$416.09
 
Seven months ago, we proposed our Compensation package, which reflected the current industry norms. We are approximately 39% below the three legacy carriers, whose rates further increase by an additional 4% in January. An additional factor is that the IPA and UPS are currently in negotiations, and the IPA has historically performed well in bargaining compensation. On Friday, during the last hour of our session, the Company presented its Compensation package.
 
If you're short on reading time, please note the following upfront: To ensure complete clarity, the Company's proposal is wholly off target. The pay rates are woefully out of line with any industry comparison and compounded by a demand that we relinquish Block over 8/10. Additionally, the FO/Captain book rate ratio decreased. To add insult to injury, there was a complete non-acceptance of our "snap-up" to UPS rates, international override increases, and the Long Range Premium.
 
Specifically, the following details are essential to understand the enormity of management's misfire. Their initial 24% increase places the top-of-scale hourly pay rates for Wide Body and Narrow Body Captains at $416.09 and $358.68, respectively. Their duration is a five-year contract with 4 x 3% pay increases over the life of the Contract. ALPA's E&FA informed us afterward that a comparison of the first four years of the Company's offer to our four-year proposal results in approximately $1.2 billion in payroll gap. Out of the gate, we are roughly $300 million apart at the effective date of the Agreement. From an industry comparative standpoint, at the end of management's proposed five-year deal, we would be roughly on par with the current pay rate of the legacy carriers.
 
Regarding APRP, their amount is "TBD," but they made clear there was no interest in paying for delays attributed to ALPA. Don't let that faze you; it is a typical management approach, and this pass was their initial bargaining salvo.
 
The following, however, should faze you immensely. If the TA passes, regarding 15-year Wide Body rates, we would be approximately $ 7/ hour ahead of the failed TA pay structure. Unfortunately, and this is truly unfortunate, the management proposed increase is financed by the proverbial rearrangement of the deck chairs, with the RMS Titanic being the appropriate reference vessel. The proposed elimination of Block Over 8 and 10, which have been in our Contract since 2006 and before, negates any perceived increase over the TA. Furthermore, our line guarantees are below the industry standard. When we advanced improvements to the trip and duty rigs, management clutched their pearls, stating they would rather spend that money on the pay rates. Where did that money go? Perhaps they were carjacked on Lamar Ave.
 
No matter your union political persuasion or internet chat group affiliation, the Company's pay proposal should disabuse you of the mythical acceptable offer that was allegedly coming our way in the spring of '24.
 
Finally, regarding the Company's Compensation proposal- management reluctantly proposed their position. That was a by-product of mediation. We have known for a long time that this proposal would roil the membership. For our committee, it is appropriate that management's valuation of you has come to light. As rumored since the fall of '23, FedEx has chosen not to recognize your contribution to the Corporation's bottom line and add significant additional money to the failed TA. That's not a successful strategy from our standpoint.
 
Let us close with the following. Those of us intimately involved with the bargaining process knew this day was coming. We've informed the NMB that we could narrow our differences once every section was out in the open. We will act accordingly while complying with the MEC's (and your) direction.
 
If the above was not enough relevant information, at the beginning of our session on Wednesday, the mediator informed us that he had elected to retire and would not be available in July. Currently, we have no information on whether we will meet in June as originally scheduled, nor do we know the status of our case at the NMB.
 
Finally, our committee would like to assure you that our commitment to you remains unwavering. It has strengthened. Soon, there will be ample opportunities to support our collective efforts via picketing and other events. The first opportunity is this upcoming Tuesday, June 3rd (RSVP here). There are now only two teams in this endeavor. Only one of them is looking out for your best interests.
 
Remain engaged. Together, we will prevail. Thank you.
