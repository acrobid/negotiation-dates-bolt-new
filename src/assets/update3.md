# Negotiating Update 24-09

This week, we concluded our fourth round of mediated bargaining with the Company in Philadelphia. True to form, and as predicted, this week's bargaining was the initial climb up the steep slope of difficult subjects on the road to ratification. Some areas were more trying than others. In all, there were thirteen exchanges of proposals.

We started the week with the Company's response to Vacation. They opened bargaining in 2021 with the provision to increase the end-of-year clearing of the Vacation bank from 40% to 100%, which was proffered during a time of severe understaffing and rampant hiring. That's not the case now. After considerable back and forth, we arrived at a solution that should work well for both parties when the 4.A.2.b./c. "Sword of Damocles" isn't hanging over our collective heads. This solution provides the Company and the pilots with increased flexibility and even further flexibility provided both ALPA and the Company agree (annually) to the increase in the bank clearing. This understanding allowed for Section 7 to be TA'd.

Afterward, the Company responded to our Sections 4, 12, and 25 ("work rules"â€”Minimum Guarantees and Other Pay Provisions, Hours of Service, and Scheduling) proposals from the Chicago bargaining. As predicted, they essentially dismissed them out of hand. Accordingly, a lot of red strike-throughs came our way. Our concerns regarding extensions, revisions, reserve duty, 4.A.2.b./c, duty, and trip rigs were disregarded. Even our zero to very-little-cost items garnered no interest.

We were unquestionably disappointed with this response. These sections directly affect significant portions of our working and personal lives. We have substantial differences with the Company regarding 4.A.2.b./c. The SAM does not work for us, and as such, we are open to finding a different metric to measure the staffing level. We are working with ALPA's E&FA Department to see if such an animal exists. If so, there could be an alternative path rather than the complete removal of 4.A.2.b./c.

The editorial comment on this Company move is that they are still extremely unhappy with the 2023 TA's rejection. We hear this every time the Company team submits their proposals. Euphemistically, they still haven't gotten over the divorce. We have progressed through the grieving process in a much better and faster fashion and are going forward. It's all that we can do. They also need to go forward. We will keep our heads down and press on zealously representing you. To that end, we provided a Section 12 counterproposal and will let you know as it develops.

This week, considerable time was spent on Section 26, the general catch-all section. We believe progress can be made towards commuting enhancements and flight safety data issues. Hopefully, a TA can be reached in this section the next time we meet.

Deviation Banks continue to be an area of focus in Section 8. We are seeking a new construct to improve our ability to retain some of our deviation monies for an extended period. While progress has been made, we are not there yet. It is important to note that as your representatives at the table, we are equally charged with making deals beneficial to you while simultaneously avoiding bad deals. Section 8 represents one such area. Previously, we communicated that we would be fully transparent about negotiations up to the point that such communications might hinder progress. That's where we find ourselves right now in this section, and for the time being, we will intentionally limit Section 8 communication for the good of the process.

Overall, this week was a tough bargaining week, with less than desired progress achieved. Our subsequent sessions will continue to cover challenging subjects. We will present a Scope proposal and counteroffers in the work rules sections. The Company owes us a counter to our Retirement proposal, but we are unsure if that will manifest in December.

In closing, thank you for your continued support, especially to the rally attendees. The rally was a great success. We will continue to update you as events happen. There should soon be a new "Unscripted" video with Greg and John. Finally, a new UNH telephone poll will start on December 2nd. Please participate if called.

Thanks, and have a great Thanksgiving!

John, Tom & Alan
