# Negotiating Update 24-11

_"They are who we thought they were!"_ -Dennis Green

Our mediated bargaining session finished on Thursday in Philadelphia. This week, we presented our Scope proposal and exchanged multiple passes on Sections 8 ("Deadheading") and 26 ("General"). We also provided the Company with a presentation by ALPA E&FA on metrics associated with 4.A.2.b/c, and the Company responded to our last Section 12 ("Hours of Service") proposal. We achieved a TA in Section 26 that provides commuting protection enhancements.

Regarding Scope, we desire to maintain the Company's ability to conduct business and achieve future growth while protecting our pilots' careers. To that end, our outside counsel, Michael Winston, presented numerous concepts emphasizing transparency and protection. Additionally, we proposed a "no furlough" clause that would apply to all pilots on the Master Seniority List at the effective date of the new CBA as part of the Scope term sheet supposal.

We previously mentioned that there was a significant issue holding up Section 8. After multiple exchanges over the last several sessions, there is a new construct for the Deviation and Hotel Room Cancellation Banks that would allow the pilots to retain deviation monies for a significant amount of time. Unfortunately, Section 8, which is now in the Company's possession, cannot be TA'd due to the Company's insistence and continual reinsertion of a provision allowing Deadheading on Company aircraft, both mid-trip and on the front/back end. The Company has sought after this concept for several years with multiple ALPA Negotiating Committees. Here's the proposed language, which is problematic on multiple levels (available commuting seats for our pilots, Deviation Bank, system form efficiencies, reduced layovers, PIC authority, etc.):

"8.A.3.d. Scheduling of Deadheads on Company Aircraft

Notwithstanding Section 8.A.3.c., the Company may schedule deadheads on Company aircraft operating:
International flight sequences, for the purposes of accomplishing mid-trip deadheads;
Intercontinental flight sequences other than for the purposes of accomplishing mid-trip deadheads, provided, however, that such deadheading pilots shall:
have access to an onboard rest facility (e.g., bunk, crew rest module); and
receive deviation bank credit of $2,250."
There is no doubt that the Company knows our strong opposition. We expect Section 8 will be “put on the shelf” for now and may not see the light of day until we are much further down the road, perhaps until the very end of negotiations. That's unfortunate, and this Section is a microcosm of recent events.

Regarding Section 12, the Company responded to our last supposal with the continued strikethrough of our proposed reduction in trip extension limits from 36 hours (domestic)/84 (international) to 24/48, respectively. The Company continually conveys that there are no issues with revisions and extensions. We vehemently disagree! They essentially redlined the significant areas in the Section 12 proposal again.

Switching to an overall recap of negotiations, to date all of our Sections are before the Company. Section 1 was the last to sequence, as it is incredibly complex, and we were awaiting requested data from the Company from October in Chicago. We received some of that data but not all of it. We finally had to proceed without all the data, which did not help us refine our proposal. We are still awaiting that and other non-Scope-related data.

The Company has not countered our Retirement and Compensation supposals submitted in Chicago during the 3rd week of October. To successfully negotiate a comprehensive CBA, both parties need to know and understand the positions of all open sections to arrive at a satisfactory solution. For example, our W-2s are not solely comprised of hourly rates; there are pay equations in Section 4 that greatly influence our compensation. Tangentially, disruption and revision pay formulas are triggered by provisions in our work rules sections. We need to know and understand the whole story, especially Compensation (Sec 3), before we even consider any adjustments to our work rules package (Sec 4, 12, & 25) or our proposal on pay rates. We would be negotiating against ourselves to do otherwise.

There is little doubt that the Company is on the fast track to 4.A.2.c. This entry into 4.A.2.c will be unwarranted and hurtful to our members. That's by design. The Company's true colors have emerged. In a 2006 NFL post-game press conference, Coach Dennis Green emphatically stated, when talking about their opponent, "They are who we thought they were!" There is now absolutely no doubt how our Company values us. We acknowledge that some of our colleagues and friends have been terminated throughout the Company and have experienced significant hardship and difficulties. However, it is not lost on us that only our employee group will soon experience a pay cut via 4.A.2.c, while the Company's bottom line remains very healthy. Even a casual observer of the negotiating process can readily see that the bargaining environment has been fouled.

Due to the lack of progress made in negotiations by both parties, the NMB has canceled our January meeting dates. We know and completely understand that many of you will find this to be distressing information. This news, coupled with the January bidpacks and what we appear to be facing in February, paints a bleak outlook for our members. Our committee remains fully ready to negotiate, but we require a willing partner. In the interim, we will continually prepare, re-examine everything, and incorporate the most recent telephone poll results into our strategy. This period will also allow more data to populate, which will most likely further confirm our suspicions regarding the reliance on revisions, extensions, and the like. In closing, we knew this would be challenging and difficult. Our committee remains steadfast in delivering you a contract reflecting your contribution to the Company's bottom line. Now, more than ever, you should avail yourselves of every ALPA resource to assist you during these turbulent times. For example, we highly recommend listening to Marty Harrington's most recent podcast.

We will continue to stay in touch with you frequently.

Thanks for your time.

John, Tom & Alan
