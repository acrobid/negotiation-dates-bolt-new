# Negotiating Update 24-08

This week, we concluded our third round of mediated bargaining with the Company in Memphis. You may recall that we presented our entire economic package in Chicago. As such, our committee was initially in the "receive" mode this week concerning the initial bargaining passes. In total, there were 10 exchanges between the parties.

In the interest of time and content, rather than providing a chronological recap this update will focus on the issues and developments. This week, we received Company responses concerning Sections 5, 7, 8 and 15. Section 5 focused on per diem rates, expense reports, and non-contract hotel issues. Section 7 dealt with end-of-year vacation buybacks and voluntary/involuntary vacation cancellations. Section 8 centered on the deviation bank system and transparency issues. Section 15 dealt with FAA medical expenses, HIMS issues, and everybody's favorite - travel CPAP machines.

The Section 5 bargaining resulted in a partial TA. We achieved some initial increases in per diem rates with a marker for further increases at a later date TBD, dependent on the duration of the contract. Section 7 bargaining identified two distinct viewpoints regarding vacation buyback and the relationship with staffing levels. In 2021, the Company initially proffered the ability to sell back 100% of your vacation when hiring was at a breakneck pace and severely understaffed. Unfortunately, that's not where we currently find ourselves. Obviously, we have concerns with that concept while the SAM drifts southward. We hope to resolve our differences next week in Philadelphia.

Section 8 deviation bank bargaining initiated by us in Chicago recognizes the resultant product in the rejected TA. However, we seek a new construct that allows for longer retention of monies in a reserve bank system to capture the deficit when the deviation bank halving ensues. Our desire to retain our deviation funds is directly related to the commuting challenges we have encountered since the cessation of the USPS contract. We hope to resolve this area next week.

Section 15 bargaining resulted in a TA providing future increases in FAA medical reimbursement, clarification language for reimbursing medical expenses not covered through insurance associated with obtaining and maintaining a special issuance medical, and streamlining administrative procedures that a HIMS pilot may encounter.

On a very positive note, Section 15 bargaining allowed for the resolution of some insurance grievance issues found within Grievance 23-05 and two non-grievance coverage issues. The Company agreed to the resumption of TeleHealth coverage through Anthem network providers effective March 2025. The Association readily welcomes this news and greatly appreciates the Company's efforts. Finally, there is a provision for a $500 reimbursement for the purchase of a portable CPAP machine on a five-year interval.

In addition to the above, we spent considerable time specifying our issues with Scope as we currently understand the Companyâ€™s restructuring plans and its overall situation. We continue to wait on the necessary data from the Company to articulate an appropriate proposal that provides our Pilots with meaningful protection and allows both parties to move forward together.

Our committee will receive counterproposals from the Company in Sections 4, 7, 8, 12, 25, and 26 next week. Right now, we do not owe any proposals.

Next week, the bargaining gradient will steepen as we venture into more challenging territory. Given our circumstances, both parties remain apart, which is natural.

As this process moves along, your unwavering support will be the best leverage our committee can use at the table. We hope to see you at our "3 Year Amendable Date Rally" tomorrow at 5:00 p.m., November 16th, in Memphis at the FedEx Event Center. Thanks, and we will touch base with you after the conclusion of next week's bargaining.

John, Tom & Alan
